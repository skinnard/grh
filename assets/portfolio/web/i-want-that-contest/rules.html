        </ol>
        <p>Entrants selected to be awarded a prize must successfully answer a skill-testing question. If a selected entrant(s) cannot be reached within 72 hours of the random draw, declines the prize, incorrectly answers the skill-testing question, or if
            a selected entrant fails to meet any of the contest conditions, his/her entry will be voided and another selected entrant will be randomly chosen from the remaining valid entries. In order to be awarded a prize, each selected entrant must
            correctly answer, without mechanical or other assistance, a time-limited mathematical skill-testing question to be administered by telephone, email or mail at a mutually convenient time. Selected entrants will be contacted by the Contest Sponsor
            by telephone or email. The odds of winning depend upon the number of eligible entries received. Prize(s) must be accepted as awarded and are not transferable, exchangeable, or convertible to cash except in the sole discretion of the Contest
            Sponsor. If, as a result of an error relating to the entry process, drawing, or any other aspect of the contest, there are more potential winners of prizes selected than contemplated in these rules, there will be a random draw amongst all
            such eligible prize claimants after the contest closing date to award the correct number of prizes. A selected entrant will be drawn from all eligible entries which were submitted at the time of each draw to be awarded a Prize (draw dates
            listed above). It is to the Contestant&rsquo;s advantage to submit a proper entry early so as to be entered into multiple draws (dates listed above). There is a limit of one prize, grand prize or secondary prize per person per household during
            the Contest&nbsp;Period. If a selected entrant&rsquo;s name is selected for the May 12 draw, their entry is null and void for all remaining draws (during the Contest&nbsp;Period). </p>
        <h3>PRIZES:</h3>
        <p>Ten (10) Grand Prizes will be awarded. Each prize consists of One (1) Microsoft Surface 3 7G5-00001 10.8&quot; Touchscreen with Intel&reg; x7-Z8700, 64 GB of storage, 2 GB RAM and Windows 8.1 valued at $639.99 each and One (1) Surface 3 Type Cover
